# AIVengers

This project uses TF-IDF to generate True/False quiz questions from text files.

## Instructions for Adding New Topics to the Test Bank

1. **Gather Content**: Collect relevant information or content based on the topic you want to generate quiz questions for.
2. **Create a Text File**: Save the content as a `.txt` file. The file name should reflect the topic (e.g., `Array Basics.txt`).
3. **Add to Test Bank Folder**: Move the `.txt` file into the `Test Bank` folder located in the project directory.
4. **Update Code with File Name**: In the code, add the new fileâ€™s name to the list of files processed by the quiz generator. This list is located in the `file_paths` variable.

## Instructions to Run Code Locally

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure you are in a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
   - Run the following command to install the required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Run the Code**:
   - Run the main Python file to generate quiz questions from the text files in the `Test Bank` folder.

## Sample Code Execution

If the main file is `generate_quiz.py`, you can run it with:
```bash
python generate_quiz.py
```

# Algorithm Explanation: Quiz Question Generation

This algorithm generates True/False quiz questions by analyzing text files using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). Below is a breakdown of the main steps involved: calculating TF-IDF scores, selecting key terms, and generating True/False questions.

## Step 1: Calculate TF-IDF Scores

1. **TF-IDF Vectorization**:
   - The `calculate_tfidf` function applies TF-IDF vectorization to the text content using `TfidfVectorizer` from `scikit-learn`.
   - TF-IDF scores reflect the importance of each term relative to the text, with higher scores indicating terms that are more significant within the document.

2. **Score Extraction**:
   - Each term and its TF-IDF score are stored in a dictionary, where the keys are terms and values are the associated scores. This dictionary is used in the next step to identify the most relevant terms for quiz question generation.

## Step 2: Select Key Terms for Quiz Questions

1. **Key Term Selection**:
   - The `select_quiz_terms` function sorts the terms in descending order based on their TF-IDF scores.
   - Terms with higher TF-IDF scores are considered more relevant to the topic and are prioritized for selection.

2. **Variety Through Random Selection**:
   - To avoid repetitive questions, a random offset (`variation`) is applied to the selection process. This introduces variety by selecting terms from a broader range, rather than just the absolute top terms.
   - The function selects a specified number of terms (`n_terms`), which are then used to create True/False quiz questions.

## Step 3: Generate True/False Statements

1. **Sentence Splitting**:
   - The text is split into individual sentences, allowing each sentence to serve as a potential source for quiz questions based on the selected key terms.

2. **True Statement Creation**:
   - For each key term, a sentence containing the term is identified.
   - A **True** statement is created using this sentence in its original form, reflecting an accurate statement based on the text.

3. **False Statement Creation**:
   - A **False** statement is generated by replacing the key term with a randomly chosen alternative term from the list of key terms.
   - This substitution creates a plausible but incorrect statement, which can be used to test understanding.

4. **Duplicate Filtering**:
   - The function removes duplicate statements by tracking sentences and phrases already used, ensuring each quiz question is unique.

## Summary

In summary, this algorithm:
1. Calculates TF-IDF scores to identify important terms in the text.
2. Selects a varied set of high-relevance terms for quiz generation.
3. Generates True/False quiz questions by creating both accurate (True) and altered (False) statements based on the selected terms.

This approach efficiently generates questions that capture key concepts, ensuring a varied and meaningful quiz for each topic.
